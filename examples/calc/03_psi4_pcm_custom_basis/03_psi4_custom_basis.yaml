 # When different basis sets/ECPs are needed for different atoms
 # then 'basis' also supports a more complex input. 'assign' must
 # always be present, as it specifies the default basis. Different basis
 # set for specific atom types are then added as [atom]: [basis].
 #
 # The input below will use 3-21G for C and N, and the smaller STO-3G
 # basis for H.
 basis:
  assign: 3-21G
  H: sto-3g
 # Alternatively, when only one basis is needed then the simple syntax can
 # be used.
 # basis: 3-21G

 # Valid keywords for pcm are 'cpcm' and 'iefpcm'. The latter is the default.
 # Note: Psi4 probably does not support analytical gradients with PCM, making
 # it extremely costly for optimizations.
